Battery Time Remaining
======================

Show the estimated battery time remaining on top of your screen in Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion.

Why does this project exists?
-----------------------------

Apple removed the option to show the battery time remaining in the statusbar since the Mountain Lion release. This App will do exactly that, show the battery time remaining on top of your screen.

How do I install it?
--------------------

Download the source and compile it with XCode or click Downloads and hope that someone has uploaded a .app file for you to run.

Is it accurate?
---------------

The App shows the exact same time as you will see when you click the battery icon. The time is provided by Mac OS X itself and as accurate as you can get.
