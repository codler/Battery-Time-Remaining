Battery Time Remaining
======================

Show the estimated battery time remaining on top of your screen in Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion.

Why does this project exists?
-----------------------------

Apple removed the option to show the battery time remaining in the statusbar since the Mountain Lion release. This App will do exactly that, show the battery time remaining on top of your screen.

How do I install it?
--------------------

Two options:

- Download [version 0.2](http://cl.ly/1K3M0h1x0Z1b), unzip and run the App
- Download the source here from Github and compile it with XCode

Is it accurate?
---------------

The App shows the exact same time as you will see when you click the battery icon. The time is provided by Mac OS X itself and as accurate as you can get.
